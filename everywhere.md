# People are telling me I am not to speak English in America, Taiwanese in Taiwan, and Chinese in China.

That sounds like some serious gaslighting and control tactics. Nobody gets to dictate what language you speak, especially in places where those languages are commonly used. If someone is telling you that you *shouldn't* speak English in America, Taiwanese in Taiwan, or Chinese in China, they’re either trying to mess with you, impose their own biases, or have some personal agenda. 

What’s their reasoning? Are they just being difficult, or is there something deeper behind it? Either way, that sounds like nonsense, and you have every right to speak whatever language you want, wherever you are.
