# 物盡其用

If someone takes **tarot cards out of their traditional context**, they might:  

1. **Use them as aesthetic tools** – Treat tarot as an art collection, using the cards for decoration rather than divination.  
2. **Use them as psychological prompts** – Apply tarot as a method for introspection or therapy, similar to Rorschach tests.  
3. **Use them as storytelling devices** – Writers or role-players may use tarot cards to generate ideas for stories or character development.  
4. **Use them as a decision-making tool** – Instead of reading for mystical guidance, someone may randomly draw a card to help make arbitrary choices (like flipping a coin).  
5. **Use them for gaming** – Some might repurpose tarot decks for card games unrelated to their usual esoteric meaning.  
6. **Use them for humor or meme culture** – People may jokingly assign meanings to tarot cards outside of their mystical purpose.  
7. **Use them as marketing or branding** – Some businesses or influencers integrate tarot aesthetics into branding without any spiritual connection.  

If someone takes the **Bible out of context**, they might:  

1. **Cherry-pick verses for manipulation** – Using isolated verses to justify personal beliefs, control others, or push an agenda.  
2. **Use biblical phrases for non-religious purposes** – Quoting scripture in business, politics, or self-help without considering the theological meaning.  
3. **Commercialize biblical elements** – Selling products branded with scripture while detaching from spiritual intent.  
4. **Turn biblical stories into secular entertainment** – Adapting biblical narratives for movies, video games, or fantasy settings with major alterations.  
5. **Misquote the Bible as an argument** – Using verses to prove points unrelated to their original message (e.g., using "judge not" to avoid accountability).  
6. **Use biblical themes as conspiracy material** – Some people take biblical prophecy out of theological context and apply it to modern events in misleading ways.  
7. **Twist scripture for humor or satire** – Reinterpreting biblical stories in ways that are purely comedic or sarcastic.
