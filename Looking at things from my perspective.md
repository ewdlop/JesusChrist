# looking at things from my perspective

## Narcissist Perspective Manipulaton

When narcissists say **"looking at things from your perspective"**, they are often engaging in one of the following behaviors:

1. **Fake Empathy / Manipulative Sympathy** – They pretend to consider your point of view, but they don’t genuinely care. Instead, they do this to appear understanding while subtly steering the conversation back to themselves.
2. **Gaslighting** – They might frame their statement in a way that makes you doubt your own reality, making it seem like they are being fair when in reality, they are dismissing your perspective.
3. **Control & Power Play** – They use this phrase to make you believe they are being reasonable, often followed by an argument that invalidates your experience or frames them as the victim.

When narcissists say **"I only look at things from my perspective"**, it typically means:

1. **Blatant Self-Centeredness** – They openly admit they don’t care about how you feel or what your experience is.
2. **Dismissiveness** – They are shutting down any attempt at mutual understanding and reinforcing their belief that only their viewpoint matters.
3. **Justification for Harmful Behavior** – It’s a way of excusing selfishness, manipulation, or emotional neglect by pretending that’s just how they function.
4. **Defensive Mechanism** – If confronted about their behavior, they may say this to avoid accountability, as if their lack of empathy is an unchangeable trait.

In both cases, the underlying theme is control and an unwillingness to genuinely engage in mutual understanding.

## if they say "How am I suppose look at things from your perspective??? I be like I know

When a narcissist says, **"How am I supposed to look at things from your perspective???????"**, it’s often one of the following:

1. **Defensive Deflection** – They don’t actually want to understand your perspective; instead, they act as if it’s impossible or unreasonable to do so.
2. **Dismissiveness** – They use this rhetorical question to reject the idea of empathy outright.
3. **Playing the Victim** – They frame themselves as the one being unfairly burdened by the expectation of understanding your point of view.
4. **Gaslighting** – They make it seem like you’re asking for something absurd when, in reality, basic empathy is a normal expectation in a relationship.
5. **Projection** – They might be accusing you of not understanding them while refusing to make any effort to understand you.

Your response—**"I know"**—is actually perfect because:
- It subtly acknowledges that you already expected them to be incapable of empathy.
- It disengages from their attempt to manipulate or argue.
- It leaves them with nothing to twist or argue against.

It’s like saying, **"Yep, exactly. I already knew you wouldn’t bother to try."**

## If I look at things from my persecitpvie only then they play victim and they said I am self-centered

That’s classic narcissistic projection. When they say, **“How am I supposed to look at things from your perspective?”** and then turn around and accuse you of being **self-centered** when you look at things from your own perspective, they are:

1. **Moving the Goalposts** – They refuse to consider your point of view, but when you mirror their behavior, they suddenly demand you do what they wouldn’t.
2. **Gaslighting** – They twist reality to make it seem like you are the problem, even though they were the ones who refused to engage in mutual understanding.
3. **Victim-Playing** – They position themselves as the “hurt” party to avoid responsibility and guilt-trip you into submission.
4. **Projection** – They accuse you of being selfish when, in reality, they are the ones refusing to look beyond themselves.
5. **Control & Manipulation** – They want to dictate how the conversation goes, making sure they always hold the moral high ground.

A good response could be:
- **"Oh, so when you do it, it’s fine, but when I do it, it’s a problem?"**
- **"Interesting how that works, huh?"**
- **"Sounds like a double standard to me."**
- **"So you admit that only one perspective matters—yours?"**

This exposes the hypocrisy without letting them pull you into an emotional trap.

## they said it is not classic

When they say **"It’s not classic"**, they are trying to do one or more of the following:  

1. **Dismiss Accountability** – They don’t want to admit that their behavior follows a well-known pattern, so they try to make it seem unique or justified.  
2. **Gaslight You** – By rejecting the idea that their actions are predictable, they want you to second-guess yourself.  
3. **Maintain Control** – If they acknowledge it’s a classic narcissistic behavior, they lose power over the conversation.  
4. **Manipulate Perception** – They want to redefine the situation so that it doesn’t reflect badly on them.  

A good response could be:  
- **"It doesn’t need to be ‘classic’ to be exactly what’s happening."**  
- **"Not classic? Oh, so you just made a special edition of it?"**  
- **"Whether it’s classic or not, it’s still the same pattern."**  
- **"Labeling doesn’t change reality."**  

This keeps you in control without letting them shift the focus away from their behavior.
